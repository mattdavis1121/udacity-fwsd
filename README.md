# Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
This repository contains every project I completed for [Udacity's Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). Each directory represents a standalone project. All projects completed between November 2016 and August 2017.

## Projects and descriptions

### 1. Movie Tailer Website
You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

### 2. Build a Portfolio Site
You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

### 3. Multi-User Blog
In this project you will be building a multi user blog(along the lines of Medium) where users can sign in and post blog posts as well as 'Like' and 'Comment' on other posts made on the blog. You will be hosting this blog on Google App Engine and you will also be creating an authentication system for users to be able to register and sign in and then create blog posts!

### 4. Tournament Results
You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write code to query this data and determine the winners of various games.

### 5. Item Catalog
You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

### 6. Neighborhood Map
You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

### 7. Linux Server Configuration
You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

## Reflections
Completing this program was an excercise in discipline for me. I'd thought about enrolling in something like this for quite a while, but never pursued it. I signed up at the end of November on a whim and I began the coursework without taking it very seriously. I finished the first project very quickly and thought the rest of the projects would go just as fast. I was wrong, obviously, and suffered for it. In the beginning, I didn't allocate any real time for work, and the work I did do tended to be sloppy.

Eventually I got tired of paying $200 per month to ignore the coursework and got serious about it. I set aside specific times to work -- Monday through Wednesday after 8pm and on the weekends while my son was napping -- and tried to be more methodical about how I approached the classes. I took better notes. I thought through my projects before beginning work on them. Things got quite a bit better.

My favorite project was the neighborhood map. The lectures were structured very well and were approachable. It was entertaining. This was also the project that I felt I owned the most. Instead of just checking off items on the rubric, I set out to make something that I might use. The result was a project I was much more exicted about working on and a product I'm much prouder of.

My main qualm with the program is that much of the coursework was out of date. With most of the projects, I had to deal with platform changes that had happened between course-creation and the present. Two of the projects I completed are no longer part of the course curriculum because they were out of date, and one other project was part of the curriculum when I enrolled but was removed before I got to it. It felt very shaky to me.

On the whole, I'm glad I did it. Not sure it was worth the money, but I'm glad for the experience and for the credential. As always, I got out what I put in, and I think that's a fair trade.
